# Day 1

Today I didn't manage to contribute anything useful for the team. I started this week full of enthusiasm and wanted to create a Kanban board in Jira, but then realized that the board isn't free. I decided to set up a project board in Github instead. I spent some time trying to figure out where to start, but quickly realized that I still don't fully understand the process.
